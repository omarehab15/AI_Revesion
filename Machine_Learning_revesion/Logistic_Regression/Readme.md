# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression 🫀📈

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical features.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is [Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) and includes 918 patient records with features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Max Heart Rate 
- Exercise-induced Angina
- Oldpeak
- ST_Slope
- HeartDisease (Target)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized feature distributions and correlations (heatmap, countplots).
3. **Model Training**
   - Trained a Logistic Regression model on the preprocessed data.
4. **Evaluation**
   - Achieved **84% accuracy** on test data.
   - Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix.

## 🧠 Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 84%
- The model performs well in binary classification of heart disease presence.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Try other classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
